# 🛫 Flight Price Prediction

Predicting flight ticket prices using machine learning models trained on airline datasets.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Flight prices fluctuate due to multiple factors such as airline, travel class, stops, seasonality, and demand.  
This project applies **data science and machine learning** techniques to:

- Analyze flight booking and price trends  
- Identify key drivers of flight pricing  
- Build predictive models to estimate flight prices  

**Goal:** Help travelers, airlines, and agencies with better price predictions and smarter booking strategies.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** Publicly available flight price datasets 
- **Target Variable:** `Price` (continuous variable – flight ticket cost)  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Programming:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Data Analysis → pandas, numpy  
  - Visualization → matplotlib, seaborn  
  - Machine Learning → scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm  
  - Model Evaluation → R², MAE, MSE, RMSE  

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of prices and other features  
   - Impact of airline, stops, duration, and time on price  
   - Outlier analysis & correlations  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature engineering (e.g., extracting day/month from dates)  
   - Encoding categorical variables (One-Hot/Label encoding)  
   - Scaling numerical features  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - XGBoost and LightGBM

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Train-test split & cross-validation  
   - Metrics: R², MAE, MSE, RMSE  
   - Comparison of models  

5. **Insights & Business Value**  
   - Identifying which airlines, routes, and timings affect price most  
   - Recommendations for cost-efficient bookings

## 📊 Visualizations

- Flight price distributions
- Boxplots of price by airline, class, stops
- Correlation heatmaps 
- Actual vs Predicted price plots

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Deploy as a Flask/Django web app
- Integrate with real-time flight APIs
- Use deep learning models for comparison
- Hyperparameter optimization with Optuna
